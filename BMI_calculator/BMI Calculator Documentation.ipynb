    "## BMI Calculator Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a Python script that implements a BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator using the Tkinter library for GUI (Graphical User Interface) and the PIL (Python Imaging Library) library for image processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The BMI calculator allows users to input their height and weight, and it calculates their BMI based on the input. It also provides a brief description of the BMI category and associated health risks. The calculator includes a graphical representation of the height using a slider and an image.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tkinter: The standard GUI library for Python.\n",
    "- PIL (Python Imaging Library): A library for opening, manipulating, and saving many different image file formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "### GUI Layout\n",
    "\n",
    "The BMI calculator GUI consists of the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Window Setup:\n",
    "  - The script creates a Tkinter window with the title \"BMI Calculator\" and a size of 470x580 pixels.\n",
    "  - The window is set to be non-resizable.\n",
    "  - The background color of the window is set to \"#f0f1f5\" (a light gray shade).\n",
    "\n",
    "- BMI Calculation:\n",
    "  - Users can input their height and weight in the provided entry boxes.\n",
    "  - There is a \"View Report\" button that triggers the BMI calculation when clicked.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Result Display:\n",
    "  - The calculated BMI value is displayed in a large label.\n",
    "  - A smaller label below the BMI value provides a description of the BMI category and associated health risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Image Display:\n",
    "  - The GUI includes two image boxes for decorative purposes.\n",
    "  - The height value is represented graphically using a man image that changes its size based on the height value.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sliders:\n",
    "  - Two sliders are provided to adjust the height and weight values:\n",
    "    - The first slider adjusts the height value and is displayed horizontally.\n",
    "    - The second slider adjusts the weight value and is also displayed horizontally.\n",
    "    - The slider values are reflected in the corresponding entry boxes and update the graphical representation accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "The script defines several functions to handle different aspects of the BMI calculator:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `BMI()`: This function is executed when the \"View Report\" button is clicked. It retrieves the height and weight values, calculates the BMI, and updates the corresponding labels with the calculated BMI and relevant description.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `get_current_value()`: This function returns the current value of the height slider as a formatted string.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `update_image_height()`: This function updates the displayed image of the man based on the height value. It resizes the image according to the height value and sets the new image in the corresponding label.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `slider_changed(event)`: This function is called whenever the height slider value changes. It updates the height value in the entry box and triggers the update of the graphical representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `get_current_value2()`: This function returns the current value of the weight slider as a formatted string.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `slider_changed2(event)`: This function is called whenever the weight slider value changes. It updates the weight value in the entry box.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Images and Icons\n",
    "\n",
    "The script uses several image files for decorative purposes and icons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `unnamed.png`: This image is used as the application icon.\n",
    "- `im2.png`: This image is displayed at the top of the GUI window.\n",
    "- `im3.png`: This image is used as a background for two image boxes.\n",
    "- `scale.png`: This image is used as a background for the height slider.\n",
    "- `man.png`: This image represents a man and is dynamically resized based on the height value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Styling\n",
    "\n",
    "The script uses the `ttk` module from Tkinter to apply custom styles to the GUI components. It defines two styles for the sliders (`TScale`) and configures them to have a white background.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running the Script\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the script, make sure you have Tkinter and PIL installed in your Python environment. Place the required image files in the same directory as the script or update the file paths in the code accordingly. Then, execute the script, and the BMI Calculator GUI will be displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The script assumes that the required image files are present in a directory called \"Images\" located in the same directory as the script. Please make sure to adjust the file paths if your directory structure is different.\n",
    "\n",
    "This documentation provides an overview of the BMI Calculator script, its GUI layout, functions, dependencies, and image/icon usage. For a more detailed explanation of specific code sections or functionality, you can refer to the comments and code structure within the script itself."
